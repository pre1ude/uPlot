# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The uPlot.js library currently has a monolithic structure with a single 3536-line file containing multiple logical components. This creates maintainability challenges, makes testing difficult, and reduces code readability. The goal is to refactor this monolithic structure into focused, modular components while preserving all existing functionality and API compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using uPlot.js, I want all existing functionality to remain unchanged after refactoring, so that my existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored uPlot.js is used THEN all public API methods SHALL function identically to the original implementation
2. WHEN existing uPlot.js applications are run with the refactored code THEN they SHALL produce identical visual output
3. WHEN the constructor is called with existing parameters THEN it SHALL accept the same signature and options
4. WHEN events are fired THEN they SHALL maintain the same timing, data, and behavior as the original
5. WHEN plugins are used THEN the plugin system SHALL continue to work without modifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining uPlot.js, I want the code split into logical, focused modules, so that I can understand and modify specific functionality more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each module SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN looking at module size THEN no single module SHALL exceed 500 lines of code
3. WHEN reviewing module structure THEN each module SHALL follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
4. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN modules SHALL have minimal and clear interdependencies
5. WHEN exploring the codebase THEN the module organization SHALL be intuitive and logical

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer testing uPlot.js, I want individual components to be testable in isolation, so that I can write focused unit tests and identify issues more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN each module SHALL be importable and testable independently
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN module interfaces SHALL be well-defined and mockable
3. WHEN running tests THEN individual modules SHALL not require the full uPlot instance to test core logic
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN module boundaries SHALL make it clear which component is responsible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on uPlot.js performance, I want the refactoring to maintain or improve performance characteristics, so that applications using uPlot.js don't experience degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring initialization time THEN the refactored version SHALL not be slower than the original
2. WHEN measuring rendering performance THEN frame rates SHALL be maintained or improved
3. WHEN measuring memory usage THEN the refactored version SHALL not use significantly more memory
4. WHEN profiling the application THEN there SHALL be no new performance bottlenecks introduced

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending uPlot.js, I want the module structure to follow existing project patterns, so that the codebase remains consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the file structure THEN new modules SHALL follow the same patterns as the existing paths/ directory
2. WHEN looking at import/export patterns THEN modules SHALL use consistent ES6 module syntax
3. WHEN reviewing code style THEN modules SHALL maintain the existing coding conventions
4. WHEN analyzing the build process THEN the refactored modules SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing build tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating uPlot.js, I want the main entry point to remain unchanged, so that existing import statements and build processes continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing uPlot THEN the main uPlot.js file SHALL remain the primary entry point
2. WHEN using build tools THEN existing build configurations SHALL continue to work without modification
3. WHEN accessing the library THEN the default export SHALL maintain the same structure and interface
4. WHEN using CDN or script tags THEN the global uPlot object SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer debugging uPlot.js issues, I want clear module boundaries and error handling, so that I can quickly identify which component is causing problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN stack traces SHALL clearly indicate which module is involved
2. WHEN debugging THEN module boundaries SHALL be evident in development tools
3. WHEN issues arise THEN error messages SHALL provide context about which component failed
4. WHEN tracing execution THEN the flow between modules SHALL be clear and logical

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to uPlot.js, I want comprehensive documentation of the new module structure, so that I can understand how components interact and where to make changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing modules THEN each SHALL have clear documentation of its purpose and interface
2. WHEN understanding dependencies THEN module relationships SHALL be documented
3. WHEN making changes THEN the impact on other modules SHALL be clear from documentation
4. WHEN onboarding new contributors THEN the module structure SHALL be self-explanatory
